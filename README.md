# income_with_decisiontree
Predicting income with a decision tree based on the  ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3).


This codes creates a decision tree, which rests on the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm">ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)</a> algorithm. The supervised learning decision tree algorithm enables to make predictions about observations recognizing nonlinear interactions between variables.

The predictions made here are "whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. Also known as "Census Income" dataset". The data set is taken from the <a href = "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult">Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems</a>.
